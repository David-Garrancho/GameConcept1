About
This is the GODOT 4 version of this plugin. If you're looking for the GODOT 3 version, please go here

This plugin allows you to create nicely textured 2D polys. Simply place a few points then create / assign the shape material and you should have a good looking polygon.

The textures used are similar to what you would use if making terrain using TileMaps/TileSets

If you find any issues, by all means let us know. Read the section below on Contributing and post an issue if one doesn't already exist

If you enjoy this tool and want to support its development, I'd appreciate a coffee :)
